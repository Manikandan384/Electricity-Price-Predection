## Introduction



This project focuses on electricity price prediction using time series forecasting techniques. The code and instructions provided here allow you to train and evaluate models for electricity price prediction.



## Project Description



The project consists of the following components:



- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

- Model selection and training

- Evaluation of forecasting performance

- Visualization of results



## Getting Started



### Prerequisites



Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:



- Python 3.x

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Statsmodels (for ARIMA)

- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning models)

- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)



You can install Python packages using pip:



```

Pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn jupyter

```



### Installation



1.	Clone this repository to your local machine:



```

Git clone https://github.com/Manikandan384/Electricity-Price-Predection



2.	Change to the project directory:



```

Cd electricity-price-prediction

```



3.	electricity price dataset in the project folder (e.g., `electricity_prices.csv`).



## Usage



To run the code for electricity price prediction:



1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Execute the code using the Python interpreter:



For ARIMA model:



```

Python arima_electricity_price_prediction.py

```



For machine learning models (e.g., LSTM):



```

Python machine_learning_electricity_price_prediction.py

```



## Code Structure



- `arima_electricity_price_prediction.py`: Contains the code for ARIMA modeling.

- `machine_learning_electricity_price_prediction.py`: Contains the code for machine learning modeling.

- `electricity_prices.csv`: Sample dataset (replace with your own data).

- `results/`: Directory to store model results and plots.



## Dataset



Replace the `electricity_prices.csv` file with your own dataset. Ensure that the dataset has a ‘Date’ column and an ‘Electricity_Price’ column.



## Model Selection



You can choose between ARIMA or machine learning models for forecasting. Adjust the code to meet your specific modeling requirements.



## Evaluation Metrics



The code calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics. You can modify the code to include additional metrics if needed.



## Results



The code generates plots and evaluation metrics in the `results/` directory
